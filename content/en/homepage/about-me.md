I'm a Linux enthusiast and a Python developer. I'm currently working as a IT support engineer while studing an AI master.

In my background there is experience in the industry, working as Maintenance Engineer and other Electrical related positions. More [here](#electrical-engineering-jobs).

My dream job combines Electrical and Data Science-AI Engineering.

##### Hobbies

Basketball, fitness, biergarten and wandering. So simple.

- 🏀 I started playing basketball when I was six. I’m far from perfect, but I still love the game.
- 🏋️‍♂️ As one gets older, it gets harder to play team sports—that's when the gym really comes to the rescue.
- 🌿🍃✨ *Wanderlust, Orndung & Sauberkeit* (cleanliness). Who doesn't fancy those things?

##### Languages

- 🇩🇪 To maintain my fluency in German I watch the [Tageschau](https://www.tagesschau.de/) and reports on the [ARD-Mediathek](https://www.ardmediathek.de/) daily. My favorite late-night show is [extra 3](https://www.ndr.de/fernsehen/sendungen/extra_3) and the most hilarious comedian is [Harry G](https://www.youtube.com/c/HarryG_offiziell).
- 🇨🇳 My Mandarin is improving little by little.
- 🇬🇧 Since English is everywhere, I read, write and listen to it a lot.
