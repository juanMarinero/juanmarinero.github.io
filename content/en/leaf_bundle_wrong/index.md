title: "Hugo's leaf bundle wrong index.md"
---

In a *leaft bundle* just `index.md` is rendered as an individual page. Current page.

- The [`/leaf_bundle_wrong/post_1`](/leaf_bundle_wrong/post_1) link does **not** work.
- The [`/post_1`](/post_1) link does **not** work.

A *branch bundle* does not has this problem:
- The [`/leaf_bundle_to_branch_bundle/post_1`](/leaf_bundle_to_branch_bundle/post_1) link works.

Keep reading [Hugo's page bundles](/blogs/hugo_page_bundles/) post.
